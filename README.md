# Rust 3D Game - SPACE MAZE

This project is 3D raycasting game built in Rust. It features a first-person view rendered using raycasting techniques, with a 2D minimap for navigation. The gameplay includes player movement, sprite rendering, and an objective to reach a goal within a maze. Performance is monitored with an FPS counter to ensure smooth gameplay.


## Libraries

- **minifb**: This library is used for window creation and handling basic input events like keyboard input. It provides a simple framebuffer that you can manipulate to draw graphics directly.
- **nalgebra_glm**: A library for linear algebra operations, specifically used here for 2D vector operations (Vec2), which are essential for player movement and raycasting calculations.
- **once_cell**: This library provides a way to initialize static variables lazily and safely.
- **rusttype**: This library handles text rendering, allowing you to draw text on the screen with custom fonts and scaling.
